# csjspg

A Clojure/JavaScript playground for browser showboating (and flirting with the Dark Side of dynamic web devel that is React.JS).

## Usage

Run it, presumably start a Jetty/HTTP-Kit/Servlet-genclass/nginx-clojure instance, pull in whatever namespace is interesting, attach to Light Table, paste in the WebSocket code in &lt;head&gt;, make heads spin by executing JavaScript/ClojureScript on Clojure-generated HTML/JSON/SMILE(/JS?) from your secret development fortress.
